This is the code for an updated version of the 1.6.4 mod "Secret Agent Craft." I have ported this mod to 1.20.1 for nostalgia reasons, as such, the mods textures are all old, the mobs are not fancy, and it is truly just an 1.20.1 port of the mod. Some items have different functions, but that is because of my non-understanding of the original creators code.
